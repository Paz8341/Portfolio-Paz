# Portfolio-Paz

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.

The portfolio is built using HTML and CSS and showcases my learning process in web development, focusing on clean structure, accessibility, and responsive design.

The project is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as I improve my skills and add new projects.
