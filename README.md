# Portfolio-Paz

This repository contains my personal portfolio website.

The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and reflects my learning process in web development, with a focus on clean structure, accessibility, responsive design, and basic client-side functionality such as navigation and language switching.

This project is a work in progress and will be continuously updated as I improve my skills and add new projects.
